<h1>Look at that text! Would anyone use that?</h1>

<aside>
  <h2>This is an <code>aside</code></h2>
  <p>
    Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully 
    understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They 
    made a good decision. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the 
    biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this 
    is politics, are they really so different? I think the only 
    difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m 
    more honest and my words are more beautiful.

  <p>
    I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! Some people have an ability to write 
  placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You 
  either have it or you don't. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It 
  chokes! You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do.
  Now a strong sentence:
  <strong>No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.</strong>
  End of the strong sentence.
  This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. That other text? Sadly, it’s no 
  longer a 10. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a 
  very good brain and I've said a lot of things. The concept of Lorem 
  Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design 
  jobs non-competitive.

<p id="next-paragraph">
  This is the next paragraph after the one containing a <code>strong</code> element.
  I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a 
  placeholding temperament. I will write some great placeholder text 
  – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – 
  and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, 
  great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make 
  Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Be careful, or I will spill 
  the beans on your placeholder text. I think my strongest asset maybe 
  by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. Lorem 
  Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why 
  it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good 
  decision.

  He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I 
  like text that wasn’t captured.

<h2>Another thing</h2>
<p>
  An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me 
  that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. This placeholder 
  text is gonna be HUGE. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my 
  temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.
</p>

<p>
  I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. We are going to make 
  placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. You have so 
  many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I 
  don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
